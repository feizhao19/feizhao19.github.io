I'm a **fifth-year Ph.D. student** in Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), under the guidance of [Dr. Chengcui Zhang](https://sites.uab.edu/czhang02/). My research interests are focused on **Machine Learning**, **Generative Model**, **Multimodal Large Language Model**, **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**, and **Cross-modal Generation** with a focus on advancing Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

<!-- Before initiating my Ph.D. in 2019, my journey began at the North University of China, where I earned my B.E. and M.E. degrees (2006-2013) and was an exchange graduate student at Tsinghua University (2011-2013). I then applied machine learning techniques in industry for **6 years** (2013-2019), progressing from **Senior to Principal Engineer**, which sharpened my skills in tackling real-world challenges. -->

Driven by a passion for technology and knowledge, my work has resulted in **16 publications (13 as first author)** in prestigious venues such as CIKM, ICME, ACM SIGSPATIAL, and ACM Computing Surveys. Throughout my Ph.D., roles as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant have further developed my leadership and collaboration skills, equipping me to make significant contributions to both academia and industry.
