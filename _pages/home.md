I'm a **sixth-year Ph.D. candidate** in Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), under the guidance of [Dr. Chengcui Zhang](https://sites.uab.edu/czhang02/). My research interests are focused on Multimodal Information Integration, with an emphasis on search, ranking, retrieval, and anomaly detection.

Driven by a passion for technology and knowledge, my work has resulted in **17 publications (14 as first author)** in prestigious venues such as ACM CIKM, IEEE ICME, ACM SIGSPATIAL, and ACM Computing Surveys. Throughout my Ph.D., roles as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant have further developed my leadership and collaboration skills, equipping me to make significant contributions to both academia and industry.
