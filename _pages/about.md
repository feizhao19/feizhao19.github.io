I'm a **fifth-year Ph.D. student** in Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), under the guidance of [Dr. Chengcui Zhang](https://sites.uab.edu/czhang02/). My research interests are focused on **Machine Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **Large Multimodal Language Model**, **Multimodal Fusion**, **Hallucination Mitigation**, **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**, and **Cross-modal Generation** with a focus on advancing Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.


Driven by a passion for technology and knowledge, my work has resulted in **16 publications (13 as first author)** in prestigious venues such as ACM CIKM, IEEE ICME, ACM SIGSPATIAL, and ACM Computing Surveys. Throughout my Ph.D., roles as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant have further developed my leadership and collaboration skills, equipping me to make significant contributions to both academia and industry.
