I'm a **sixth-year Ph.D. candidate** in Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), under the guidance of [Dr. Chengcui Zhang](https://sites.uab.edu/czhang02/). I specialize in Multimodal Information Integration, with core research in search, ranking, and retrieval systems, complemented by applied innovations in remote sensing, medical imaging, audio, medical data analysis, and computer vision.


Driven by a passion for technology and knowledge, my work has resulted in **18 publications (14 as first author)** in prestigious venues such as ACM CIKM, IEEE ICME, ACM SIGSPATIAL, and ACM Computing Surveys. Throughout my Ph.D., roles as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant have further developed my leadership and collaboration skills, equipping me to make significant contributions to both academia and industry.


As **an INFP personality**, I am guided by **strong empathy**, which allow me to deeply understand others and foster meaningful collaboration. My **creativity and imagination** enable me to explore innovative solutions in research, while my cooperative and inclusive nature helps me **build supportive, harmonious teams**. These qualities empower me to connect authentically with colleagues and contribute positively to both academic and professional environments.
